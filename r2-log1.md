# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1st, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Back watching some Data Structure and Algorithms stuff. started with Eric Traub's Data Structure and Algorithms from scratch.    
**Thoughts:** Started back up on coding. after a not-so self-imposed hiatus, is time to come back. It's been a tough couple of weeks or months to say the least. but I must find energy to continue.
