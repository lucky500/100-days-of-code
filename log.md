# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 4th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the backend of a project today. NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose, Node Restful API.   
**Thoughts:** Started back up on the 100daysofCode challenge. the biggest thing is to keep myself accountable and to post everyday.
for the most part, I usually code some everyday. I just have to get better at keeping the log and to update twitter.
