# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started with Real State Rails React App, learned about semantic UI React.

**Thoughts:** Started on my Real State React Rails app, got a minimal Webpack file going, and package.json, From the get go, I wanted to try Rails with a different solution for the UI, so this is the first day working on the app. There are couple options in getting it done, but it seems that the best option, is to have the backend and the frontend totally separated, functioning like two different apps, so I am reviewing some tutorials and videos to follow through.

### Day 2: December 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Real State App, started playing around with semantic UI for React

**Thoughts:** When you add something like React, Redux, Semantic UI and React Router, your application start to get more complex, sometimes I wonder if this level of complexity is warranted. Watching videos to learn about REDUX, eventually I will add REDUX, not because is really needed, but because I wanted to work with the technology.

### Day 3: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Removed some dead links from my portfolio, and pushed to Heroku.

**Thoughts:** I had an issue on my portfolio, where I had links to the code and to the demo, but some sites are not on Heroku, so I really don't have a demo to show. so I wanted to only show a link if there was a demo listed on my data.json file. Here is the solution:
```{ link.urlDemo ? <a href={link.urlDemo}>Demo </a> : null } ```
easy enough huh? Thank God for stackoverflow!
