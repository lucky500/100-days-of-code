# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started with Real State Rails React App, learned about semantic UI React.

**Thoughts:** Started on my Real State React Rails app, got a minimal Webpack file going, and package.json, From the get go, I wanted to try Rails with a different solution for the UI, so this is the first day working on the app. There are couple options in getting it done, but it seems that the best option, is to have the backend and the frontend totally separated, functioning like two different apps, so I am reviewing some tutorials and videos to follow through.
