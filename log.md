# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 4th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the backend of a project today. NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose, Node Restful API.   
**Thoughts:** Started back up on the 100daysofCode challenge. the biggest thing is to keep myself accountable and to post everyday.
for the most part, I usually code some everyday. I just have to get better at keeping the log and to update twitter.

### Day 2: March 5th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Started back up on front end and REDUX

### Day 3: March 6th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Did about half of the challenges on FCC's Basic Algorithm Scripting.   
**Thoughts:** Man, I suck at whiteboarding... The only way to get better at it, is to keep doing it.     

### Day 4: March 7th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: REDUX, REDUX and more REDUX   
**Thoughts:** Getting the concepts of REDUX down. It is finally starting to make some sense.. 

### Day 5: March 8th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: more REDUX.   
**Thoughts:** REDUX heavy day, following Stephen Grider tutorial. 

### Day 6: March 9th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: A bit more REDUX switched to Tyler Mcginnis tutorial.   
**Thoughts:** still more REDUX. As I am not working in a particular app, I am just following tutorials and writing code snippets. 

### Day 7: March 10th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: REACT and ES6.   
**Thoughts:** Did a bit of REACT and ES6 today. 

### Day 8: March 11th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: GraphQL.   
**Thoughts:** I have looked into GraphQL, because it looks super cool, but now I am way deep into the rabbit hole, Not sure why I am worried about this, but wanted to see what makes sense to use if I am using REDUX, Apollo everyone says, so don't worry about Relay and concentrate on Apollo, but as you dig a bit into Apollo documentation, V2 does not use REDUX under the hood, and Apollo and Relay now both takes care of state management, replacing the need for REDUX.
