# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 4th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the backend of a project today. NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose, Node Restful API.   
**Thoughts:** Started back up on the 100daysofCode challenge. the biggest thing is to keep myself accountable and to post everyday.
for the most part, I usually code some everyday. I just have to get better at keeping the log and to update twitter.

### Day 3: March 6th, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Did about half of the challenges on FCC's Basic Algorithm Scripting.   
**Thoughts:** Man, I suck at whiteboarding... The only way to get better at it, is to keep doing it.
