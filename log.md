# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Started with Real State Rails React App, learned about semantic UI React.
**Thoughts:** Started on my Real State React Rails app, got a minimal Webpack file going, and package.json, From the get go, I wanted to try Rails with a different solution for the UI, so this is the first day working on the app. There are couple options in getting it done, but it seems that the best option, is to have the backend and the frontend totally separated, functioning like two different apps, so I am reviewing some tutorials and videos to follow through.
_not much to show yet_

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Real State App, started playing around with semantic UI for React
**Thoughts:** When you add something like React, Redux, Semantic UI and React Router, your application start to get more complex, sometimes I wonder if this level of complexity is warranted. Watching videos to learn about REDUX, eventually I will add REDUX, not because is really needed, but because I wanted to work with the technology.

### Day 3: January 3, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Removed some dead links from my portfolio, and pushed to Heroku.
**Thoughts:** I had an issue on my portfolio, where I had links to the code and to the demo, but some sites are not on Heroku, so I really don't have a demo to show. so I wanted to only show a link if there was a demo listed on my data.json file. Here is the solution:
```{ link.urlDemo ? <a href={link.urlDemo}>Demo </a> : null } ```
easy enough huh? Thank God for stackoverflow!

### Day 4: January 4, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Not much progress, I was stuck for a long time messing with react-router-dom, I am still having issues with my implementation, I am hoping to at least make start the backend tomorrow, even if it's just the scaffold.
**Thoughts:** some days you just don't feel like coding at all!

### Day 5: January 5, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked very little on my Real State App. I actually solved some algorithms and did a bit of whiteboarding, because I have an interview tomorrow. I did however managed to add the backend files to my app. I will be using the stripped down version of Rails, Rails Api. Wish me luck!
**Thoughts:** do you want to complicate your life? add REDUX.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked a little bit on Redux, did some reading, did a bit of algorithms.
**Thoughts:** Need to streamline and work at one tutorial at time. I need to back to basics, since before I can start messing with REDUX, I want to be very comfortable with ReactJS.



### Day 7: January 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Did some ES6, and started a small ReactJS with GO and RethinkDB project.
**Thoughts:** One project at time. if Needed go back and read it again.

### Day 10: January 10, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Took a break from React today and tried go out. I never had this much pain in getting my Path variable to work, in the other hand, syntax is pretty nice.

### Day 11: January 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Back to React, just about finished with the first week of React on the Epicodus curriculum.   
**Thoughts:** Webpack is annoying sometimes, it was not collaborating and it took me a while to make it work.

### Day 12: January 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished week 1 of the Epicodus React curriculum. They actually change stuff around, so I had to go back and fix minor errors. Worked with Webpack and images and extract-text-webpack-plugin for the css. This.  
**Thoughts:** Although sometimes I want to look at something new like Go, that looks good, I am commited to just work on React, React-router and Redux this month.
